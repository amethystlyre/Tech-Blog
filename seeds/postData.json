Templating systems generally introduce some new syntax but are usually very simple to work with, especially if weâ€™ve used templating systems elsewhere previously (eg. Twig in PHP). A fun point to note is that token replacement is usually symbolized by double curly brackets ({{ ... }}), which Mustache and Handlebars derive their names from (hint: turn them sideways to see the similarity).",
